# 🌾 AgriSense – Intelligent Crop Observation & Forecast System

AgriSense is a smart, innovative solution designed to cater to the diverse farming needs of individuals, small-scale farmers, and large-scale agricultural setups. By combining IoT and machine learning, AgriSense provides real-time insights into field conditions to help farmers maximize yield, detect crop diseases early, and optimize irrigation schedules.

## 🚀 Features

### 📡 IoT Sensor Stick
- Equipped with **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **humidity** sensors.
- **Top-mounted camera** captures weekly plant health images.
- Deployed directly into the soil for localized monitoring.

### 📶 Wireless Communication
- Utilizes **ESP32 modules** with the **ESPNow protocol** for peer-to-peer communication.
- Sends data to a **Raspberry Pi hub** using UART protocol.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Integration
- Processes both **sensor data** and **images**.
- Predicts crop health, irrigation needs, and early signs of plant disease.
- Enables **data-driven decision-making** for farmers.

### 📊 User Dashboard
- Built using **React.js**.
- Displays real-time sensor readings, ML predictions, and custom alerts.
- Supports **local language** and **messaging integration** (SMS/Telegram).
